# 🔥 Firebase Auth Unauthorized Domain - Quick Fix

## ❌ Error
```
Firebase: Error (auth/unauthorized-domain)
```

## ✅ Solution

You need to add your development domain to Firebase authorized domains.

### Step 1: Go to Firebase Console

1. Open: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/openideax-d222b/authentication/settings
2. Or: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/openideax-d222b/settings/general/web

### Step 2: Add Authorized Domains

In the **Authorized domains** section, add:

1. **`localhost`** - For local development
2. **`127.0.0.1`** - For local IP access
3. **`192.168.0.68`** - Your network IP (if shown in terminal)
4. **`10.231.82.47`** - Your network IP (if shown in terminal)

### Step 3: Save Changes

Click "Save" and wait a few seconds for the changes to propagate.

### Step 4: Refresh Your App

After adding the domains, refresh your browser and try signing in again.

## 🚀 Quick Link

**Direct link to Firebase Authentication Settings:**
```
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/openideax-d222b/authentication/settings
```

## 📝 Alternative: Development Mode

If you can't access Firebase console right now, the app will fall back to mock authentication for development.

## ✅ After Fix

Once you add the authorized domains:
- ✅ Google Sign-in will work
- ✅ User data will save to Firebase
- ✅ Real-time collaboration will work
- ✅ User profile will show real stats

**Note**: This is a one-time setup. Once configured, it works for all local development sessions.
